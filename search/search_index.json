Feel free to contribute to this repo if there is something that i forgot and is worth to know, however, let me show you what's new. I decided to not add 'adb shell ' wich means all commands is executed when we are connected to device but of course if you want to, just add 'adb shell' infront of all commands and it will work aswell without being connected to the device shell All commands that require root will have (Root_Required) in descriptionn.

Download the Android SDK Platform Tools ZIP file for macOS. 2. Extract the ZIP to an easily-accessible location (like the Desktop for example). 3. Open Terminal. 4. To browse to the folder you extracted ADB into, enter the following command: cd /path/to/extracted/folder/ 5. For example, on my Mac it was this: cd /Users/Doug/Desktop/platform-tools/ 6. Connect your device to your Mac with a compatible USB cable. Change the USB connection mode to \u201cfile transfer (MTP)\u201d mode. This is not always required for every device, but it\u2019s best to just leave it in this mode so you don\u2019t run into any issues. 7. Once the Terminal is in the same folder your ADB tools are in, you can execute the following command to launch the ADB daemon: ./adb devices 8. On your device, you\u2019ll see an \u201cAllow USB debugging\u201d prompt. Allow the connection. 9. Finally, re-enter the command from step #7. If everything was successful, you should now see your device\u2019s serial number in macOS\u2019s Terminal window. Linux 1. Download the Android SDK Platform Tools ZIP file for Linux. 2. Extract the ZIP to an easily-accessible location (like the Desktop for example). 3. Open a Terminal window. 4. Enter the following command: cd /path/to/extracted/folder/ 5. This will change the directory to where you extracted the ADB files. 6. So for example: cd /Users/Doug/Desktop/platform-tools/ 7.Connect your device to your Linux machine with your USB cable. Change the connection mode to \u201cfile transfer (MTP)\u201d mode. This is not always necessary for every device, but it\u2019s recommended so you don\u2019t run into any issues. 8. Once the Terminal is in the same folder your ADB tools are in, you can execute the following command to launch the ADB daemon: ./adb devices 9. Back on your smartphone or tablet device, you\u2019ll see a prompt asking you to allow USB debugging. Go ahead and grant it. Windows 10 1: Download: https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip 2: Extract the contents of this ZIP file into an easily accessible folder (such as C:\\platform-tools) 3: Open Windows explorer and browse to where you extracted the contents of this ZIP file 4: Then open up a Command Prompt from the same directory as this ADB binary. This can be done by holding Shift and Right-clicking within the folder then click the \u201cOpen command window here\u201d option. 5: Connect your smartphone or tablet to your computer with a USB cable. Change the USB mode to \u201cfile transfer (MTP)\u201d mode. Some OEMs may or may not require this, but it\u2019s best to just leave it in this mode for general compatibility. 6: In the Command Prompt window, enter the following command to launch the ADB daemon: adb devices 7: On your phone\u2019s screen, you should see a prompt to allow or deny USB Debugging access. Naturally, you will want to grant USB Debugging access when prompted (and tap the always allow check box if you never want to see that prompt again). 8: Finally, re-enter the command from step #6. If everything was successful, you should now see your device\u2019s serial number in the command prompt (or the PowerShell window).

Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program\u2013to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS Definitions. \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations. To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work. A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. Source Code. The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work. A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. Additional Terms. \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. Patents. A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\". A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

It is strictly forbidden and it can end with high penalties such as imprisonment for fraudulent behavior. You are responsible for your own actions and you can never ever blame wuseman for your acts. Manipulating data of various things to deceive a third party by selling a computer where hardware figures are manipulated and false warranty can be presented is a very serious crime, in almost all countries..

If the bolded text is true ..... We are more vulnerable then ever? .. Then we should be we able to hack the Bios within seconds ....... is my first thought? \"They laught at me because i'm different. I laught at them becuase they all are the same with economic interests.\" / Edited quote, from Joker! HP: My first bios I managed to hack was from Compaq and since that day when I was 6 years old I have followed your developers for over 30 years now. We do not have to guess, we know how good your employees are from asia with extremely small salaries while you pull in billions on misleading and false advertising. Who are the \"bad guys\" in your ads? We'll see. This repo will be updated frequently and recurring as you develop your security. My first thought that appeared immediately was, if I short circuit the chip it will (please notice healing) heal itself not recover/restore itself, healing is an unusual word in these terms. I decide to belive my thoughts and the results can be found below . Sounds crazy? Maybe.. Not for me.. I love to try crazy things which should be \"impossible\". I have strangely enough succeeded with many crazy and wierd \"hacks\" of all kind that should not be possible BUT I will not lie for anyone, I have also failed a lot before I got older and wiser. These are things I will talk about that when I retire, until then I will continue to do everything in my power to try to hack time to count backwards. =) Bypassing/Hacking Secure Boot as a pro (to be updated) Visit Rod Smiths wiki for get a deeper knowledge, its an awesome wiki imo and cover everything that is worth to know imo even for none refind users: https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html This part is for Gentoo Users - Scroll down to skip this Before you will try anything I wanna tell you that you are able to bypass the secure boot protection if you have some linux skills. Windows setups can be installed always since the certs are from microsoft, ubuntu and kubuntu I know have preinstalled shim installed. This will fix this so we can boot Gentoo Minimal CD because with secureboot enable you gonna be stopped by the picture as above that says \"image did not authenticate\". BACKUP THE KEYS FROM OLDER INSTALL BEFORE YOU DOING ANYTHING STUPID AS ERASE OR RESE THE KEYS * sys-boot/mokutil Available versions: ( ~ ) 0 .3.0_p20170405 ( ~ ) 0 .5.0-r1 Homepage: https://github.com/lcp/mokutil Description: The utility to manipulate machines owner keys which managed in shim * sys-boot/shim Available versions: 15 .5-r1 Homepage: https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/shim/ Description: Fedora ' s signed UEFI shim Install shim and mokutil, no useflags are available so we just installing them as usual, you also gonna need openssl since we need this for create keys and also ca-certificates for the certs but they are probably already installed but if not: emerge -av sys-boot/mokutil sys-boot/shim app-misc/ca-certificates dev-lib/openssl First, list all enrolled or new keys mokutil --list-enrolled [ key 1 ] SHA1 Fingerprint:.... ... [ key 2 ] SHA1 Fingerprint:.... List new keys mokutil --list-new You can check the current secureboot state with: mokutil --sb-state You want to export the current keys if there is any, of course ;) mokutil --export The above command will give you .der keys in the folder you execute the command, files is named: MOK-00**.der, save all those files in some encrypted container or at least secure place (security is always nr1, encrypt everything) before you deleting them and adding new ones! You now want to delete the old keys, you can use wildcard for this part as below: mokutil --delete MOK*.der If you want, set root password: sudo mokutil --root-pw ....or a custom password sudo mokutil --password input password: input password again: Rebooted and answer the questions (comming soon more detailed) and see if the keys has been deleted ;) Enjoy the removal of the old keys! You are l33t! Create your own keys/setup enrollment Verify that MOK is enabled. Use the following commands on the target to enable or disable MOK: mokutil --enable-validation mokutil --disable-validation You use this password to manage keys using mokutil and to confirm their enrollment and other operations when the MOK manager is running. In addition to console input, mokutil supports other methods to input the password. Enroll a key certificate. Convert a standard PEM key to a DER-formatted X509 certificate for shim_cert.cer and vendor_cert.cer. openssl x509 -in shim_cert.crt -inform PEM -out shim_cert.cer -outform DER openssl x509 -in vendor_cert.crt -inform PEM -out vendor_cert.cer -outform DER Enroll the shim_cert.cer certificate. mokutil --import shim_cert.cer You must set up the password for this MoK manipulation request, as this password is required by the shim loader in the next reboot. Review the key enrollments. Use the following command to verify whether a key is active already or not: mokutil --test-key shim_cert.cer mokutil --test-key vendor_cert.cer Since the vendor_cert.cer key is the built-in certificate in the boot loader, is is enrolled during the first boot. Use the following command to list the current key enrollment requests: mokutil --list-new [ key 1 ] SHA1 Fingerprint: .........

Once the target reboots, the Shim UEFI Key Management screen is displayed where you are given below options Press: Continue boot Press: Enroll MOK, choose yes! Enroll key from disk Enroll hash from disk Enroll your keys and enter password. Enjoy Some pictures of things that failed / appeared when I played with this. There is no explanation but just sharing them for fun. Lets Try Short Circuit the Chip There is alot of people trying this already since the protection has been very good (Started with Probooks), but no public releases for the latest HP devices has been found. Good question below and good answer was provided on the url below, it simply depends! Again, be careful \"Long story short when testing some IC chips in circuit and powered on I must have touched a couple legs at once causing a chip to short. My quick question, is this damage usually contained just to the chip itself or does it spread to surrounding resistors and capacitors etc.? No smoke or burnt components or anything like that.\" Q: Is this damage usually contained just to the chip itself or does it spread to surrounding resistors and capacitors etc? A: It Depends.... It's a very hard question to answer, really. Hack to learn not learn to hack and you will figure out ;) IC Chip short circuit repercussions HP EliteDesk 800 GX + G5 (DANGEROUS METHOD) Born On Date................: ` 2022 -03-01 ` Secured by latest features..: ` yes ` Bios Chip...................: ` 25B127DSIG ` BiosProgrammer..............: ` CH341a ` Require Bios Programmer.....: ` no ` Level of difficulty.........: ` simple ` * Tools Recommended: Microscope so you can watch the legs so you are not shortcuits the wrong one by mistake * Tools Required..............: 1x Phillips screwdriver 1x Tiny wire ( I used 2 mini grabbers for safety ) G5 has extra features then older elitebooks for bios password. It is possible to set security settings to \"Ignore\" the cmos jumper and reset reset button if pressed on motherboard. If the setting is set to IGNORE you are fucked, you will NOT not succeed in getting around without programmers. so if you try on this unit and do not understand why it does not work, it is precisely because it can ignore this that many other Elitedesk can NOT. The clip is easy to find, its under the below nvme disk (if you have two) and you can read the chip via a Soic Clip 8 THIS WILL BRICK YOUR PC - DO IT ON YOUR OWN RISK!! PLEASE NOTICE THE LEGS 1, 7, 8 are from my PICTURE, NOT FROM THE DATASHEET!!! A wire on pin 1 and 7 for ~1.2s erased Intel Firmware A wire on pin 1 and 8 for ~1.0s bios noticed something happend and restore itself A wire on leg 1 and 8 for ~3.0s erased Bios Password Pins Impressive, I was wrong about all this, well well. After 1 touch on pin 1 and 8 (notice just a touch like in 0.1ms) we gonna see below I still don't trust their shit so before I saying I was wrong and they won, I try 2. seconds! Since ages back in the days for some reason I know 4.2 seconds will brick the device if we touch the pins. And this is something I just has figured out on many devices, I can't confirm or promise it will work the same for you so dont listen on this if you didnt try and then cry in pm to me I tried to hold a wire on leg 1 and leg 8, now things happens! Bios missmatch! Now its dangerous, and I'm not as impressed anymore. One more wrong and things will be bricked, Now it's 50/50 .. HP or wuseman, who's right? It will not be a fourth time I know from past experience. Fuck it, i\u00b4m to curios and since ages i know 4.2 seconds is the limit for break things as I said so I decided to try: 3.0 seconds while PC was ON running as normal.... after 3.0s I pull the AC and keep it off for 25 seconds.. The PC wont die itself so you must pull the AC REMOVE THE BATTERY BEFORE DOING THIS! Holy maria! it does not even start! Leaving AC out and pressing power button for 25 seconds, gave life to the computer, damn now it flashes red and beeps every time the led flashes! According to the HP dev manual for what 3 x beeps + 3 red flashing indicates its the CPU or GPU. What the hell? It should be 4.2 seconds before it breaks on cpu, mem, motherboard, bios or gpu! Fuck, now things was bricked! I thought \u2026After device is blinking red and fan had run at 10k rpm few times we finally have device booting, THUMBS UP! HP's manuals sucks! ;-) First screen we gonna see is that date is wrong, i didnt fix a picture on this. just press continue Second screen we gonna see is that intel firmware is fucked, press ok Intel firmware install is in progress Device reboots after a while and reading bios up to 16M will start and finally you will see the below screen. Next screen takes us to to gbe recovery (will it never ends?) Now it want us to upgrade once again, i choose yes After the shortcuit and few reboot, it was time to enter bios and see if its password protects!! IT IS GONE! Now, feel free to set your own bios password and then press F11 and choose network recovery Worlds most secured BIOS that has hardware protection was \"hacked\" in ~3.0 second! We are now able to take over windows also! (will be added later) The only question I have to HP is, did you never try this? Do you now understand why I want to have a technical analysis for your tests? You talk about losses, re-start by showing your winnings based on false advertising instead. You are a scam and fooling your customers with fabricated statistics! Fuck you! If HP's bios is the most secure bios in the world that will protect the companies from hackers incl. tpm protections and keys and keep the real black hats away from private data then it's just as true that I'm sitting on the planet \"Jupiter\" and writing this, there are no laws and rules here so therefore I do not break any laws and rules here, ezi! .. Idiots \u2026 *In hps advertising, they are the bad guys, and I the wolf hence the banner! Fuck you HP \u2026 This is just the first part, I will update this repo with MORE proofs of your lies, next up is laptops followed by printers. Stay tuned! General info about Elitedesks! There is another switch on the motherboard, its not easy to find and the switch is not available wiht chassi closed I Really recommends to use a \u00b4better clip then the cheap ones, spend some money for a 3M clip ~20-30\u20ac, the chip black ones from china sucks as hell! After 2-3 grabs it's not possible to grab the clip anymore. (probably thats why they sell those clips in 4-6xPackets on amazon - DONT BUY THOSE!!! >See yourself below after FEW grabs, it destroys the chip after few times) HP Sure Adminm / HP Sure Run and Secure PLatform Management is not provisioned anymore You are now the full admin of the system and you can erase old TPM and take over this part Followed by reset all security featrures, not eve theft protection will help the owner, we can permanent disable this (permanent is not permanent as forever, we can rewrite the chip ofc) Invalid Manifest If you got problems with system recovery via F11 and bios gonna say there is a problem with manifest as: \"error finding valid manifest\" do as below (this problem was a mess with my Elitebook 870 G3 to figure out and solve, hp now have a help part for this for several models on their site, not all devices are affected - Visit hp for more info if needed) To avoid the issue:** Do not initiate a Preboot network enabled feature when the computer is on low battery power. Avoid pressing the power button. Do not use the CTRL+ALT+DEL key combination to restart the computer while a download or upload is in progress. To work around this issue, perform the following steps to reset the IPv4 configuration: 1 . Power on the computer. 2 . Press F3 to enter the 3rd Party Option ROM Management menu. 3 . Navigate to Network Device List -> MAC:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx -> IPv4 Network Configuration. 4 . Uncheck Configured. 5 . Select Save Changes and Exit. Help with password removal I don't know if I will add this part here yet but upload your bios dump to any of the forums and I will help you or someone else will do, I am active there too for this stuff. Please dump the right file and not the firmware file from EFI file. If you really don't know what im talking about, find me on irc and I will remove the password for you, for free, dont pay for things you don't need ;) Cheers! Bios Upgrade via Linux DOwnload the bios for your device @hp .com extract the .exe file: 7x x spXXXXX.exe mkdir -p /boot/EFI/HP/BIOS/ { New,Previous,Old,Current,Temp } mount /dev/bootPartiton /boot cp spXXXXX.exe/*. { bin,ini } /boot/EFI/HP/BIOS/New unmount /boot/ reboot Now, enter F9 and choose to boot from ifle, choose the correct file. Bios will now upgrade Method 2 After you moved the correct file to New path on boot partition Turn off PC, while you holding win+b press power button for 2 seconds, release the power button but keep press win+b Bios upgrade should now start. Happy Upgrading! HP Elitebook 870 G3 (DANGEROUS METHOD) Belive it or not. You maybe thought it was just luck what I was trying, as I did. So i decided to ask a friend to try in his PC as well. See the result below, brand new laptop: I wont add all pictures again, i will show you the really needed pictures otherwise you can follow the same step as above its the same story for elitebooks with the latest bioses that is self-healing (really latest models only) So .. Short circuit trick is dangerous but I wanted to confirm this for Elitebooks also.. It's no coincidence, it's wuseman power.. nah is not, its because HP fucking sucks! I guess they spent billions of dollars in their ads and their bios is hacking by short cuiiting their bios chip and then we dont even need to fix it, it healing itself! This has to be the dumbest thing I've ever been through. As I said, it also works on elitebook! Same legs from my view, same seconds (3.0seconds) on a different chip, i toke some picture on it with my microscope. See below, no descriptions will be added unless its something I really wanna share since its the same story as above dangerous method. there is fucking expensive clips for WSON chips for ~100-300$, these. If you are careful enough, you can do the same as me, otherwise you have to take the heat gun and solder and stuff. Same as above but on the elitebook i was able to take a picture, this is how it looks after we boots first time when device has been acting as the elitedesk Didnt start Caps lock led + numlock led was flashing 7 times ( i will add a video later i cant find it now ) fan runs at 10k rpm or something, rebooting and doing this for few times and we now got into this screen: This never happened on elitedesks only on elitebook, I guess thats cause the software and efi can't communicate anymore since the bios was erased and now healed Sure Recovery, every screen that will popup Downloading Boot.wmi Downloading Boot.sdi Downloadintg BCD Device that was hacked in 3.0 seconds and I confirmed the same shit works on this healing bios. But i don't recommending anyone to try, use the safe method otherwise you may get a broken cpu,gpu,mem,motherboard or anything: Connect to wifi via CIRCA (F3 in bios menu) WIFI REQUIRED SINCE THERE IS NO ETHERNE INPUT ON THIS ONE Preparing HP Setup + Windows WSON Bios Chip 870 G3 chip is a Winbond 25Q256JVEN 2111 6048 CZ900 Tested my new microscope usb, not perfect photos but it was the first time I used it :P Other chips for test the microscrope, they pretty good. Now we have a valid license and activated Windows 10 from stock, now go reinstall firmware and get the hell out of Windows (nah, we must run some stuff here before we do that, i will add how we gonna take over TPM later) Recommended, safe way. Follow the same steps as on elitedesk but you need either a modded clip or a wson programmer, here is my modded one. My special clip in progress Enjoy! Elitebook 820 - Programmer required! The Short CIRCUIT will NOT work on this device!!! Use your programmer to dump bios and remove the password with prefered hexedit tool and write it back to device without the the bios password, its now fully unlocked! =D My modded custom clip grabbed this one aswell, you must have the pins outside the clip as on my picture the above for being able to touch the solder from the pins on the board since there is no legs, if you using a default clip it will just grab the black area and it will probably end like the picture below. See the zoomed version what happens with a non-modded / wson clipper (this is for avaoid soldering, that\u00b4s boring rly) .. If you get your clip working, there is better and more serious custom made SOP WSON SOIC VSOP SPI FLASH 8P 1.27mm on stores online, below is the modded ones from stores. Normal price on amazon is ~100-300$ but some stores in asia sell them for ~40$ - I would recommend a such one instead, its rly cool works on ALL 4x2 chips and you wont need solder anymore, connect it to your programmer or ardunio and start hack the bios dump.. I have nothing more to add here, programmer required here and if you short circuit this and think you will succeed, I can promise you, you wont! Already failed on ~2 few years ago and no new bios has been released so just buy a programmer and do it the proper way, but if you really wanna try - Go for it, i don't care and don't ask me for help about this model. Its old and and sucks! Cheers Repair SPM: This is only needed if you short circuited the bios, otherwise you can fix this in bios settings under security. For fix the SPM if its not possible to fix this from bios security settings, see below: If you short cuited the chip, the output from below command will be alot of wierd text and looks like a mess.

To view any associated logs, you can use the Get-HPFirmwareAuditLog function. The last thing you may want to do is deprovision.

The solution is meant to be management console agnostic, so whether you use SCCM, Intune, Ivanti, or whatever else, these are the basic steps: Install HPCMSL in a secure location, and place your certificates here. Also Install HPCMSL on your managed clients In the secure location, use HPCMSL to generate a secure payload, as described above, using one of the New-* functions. Copy this secure payload to your clients via your process of choice. Do not copy your certificates. On your clients, apply the payload generated in 3. above, via the Set-HPSecurePlatformPayload function.

Well, its not that easy maybe but follow below steps and everything will be fine :) Flashrom will detect your chip and know its model by itself: Read Chip flashrom -p ch341a_spi -r Read and Backup* flashrom -p ch341a_spi -r -o bios_elitebook_backup.bin or flashrom -p ch341a_spi -r > bios_elitebook_backup.bin Now erase the bios with password protected bios flashrom -p ch341a_spi -E You don't need to remove the password from the bin file from a hexeditor, bios will \"heal\" itself.. Please try. If im wrong, just remove the password via hexedit (this will not be covered in this repo at the moment, will add a tutorial how you can do this without uploading your file for help later) and re-write the chip: Not needed if you are on latest models, but in case you wanna do it: flashrom -p ch341a_spi -w hacked_bios_file_with_no_pw.bin On older bios versions, you must crack the password OR remove the password from bios file with a hexeditor \u26a0 READ + SAVE YOUR BIOS BEFORE YOU ERASING IT IN CASE SOMETHING GOES WRONG! Windows Download NeoProgrammer v2.2.0.10 and put the clip on the chip, read bios for backup and then erase it, done!

It's almost impossible to find leaked passwords after they're removed from the list on pastebin.com. Either they have been deleted by Pastebin's techs or the upload is just one in the crowd. To be honest it's easier to find a needle in a haystack then find outdated uploads on Pastebin. Parallel downloading! More than twice as fast as the previous version. 555 files downloaded, over ~20.000 accounts found via auto brute-force using one command that takes approximately 4.51 seconds (see proof below) Incredibly good results for successful attacks. There is no other tool nearby that has more successful attempts than Emagnet. Emagnet is quick, easy, unique and awesome!

Services Usage Limits You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without Pastebin's express written permission. Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through Pastebin's API. You may scrape the website for the following reasons: Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from Pastebin for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access. Archivists may scrape Pastebin for public data for archival purposes. You may not scrape Pastebin for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling Pastebin users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards. All use of Pastebin data gathered through scraping must comply with the Pastebin Privacy Statement. Emagnet users are archivists! Right ? We didn't get the recent uploads from scrape.pastebin.com , we used pastebin.com/archive , this means our usage was in compliance with the privacy statements. Whatever, this means that the Emagnet project has ended up in a pause phase as we will not go much further until this changes, but just wait. Soon the greed will come and they will open the pro section again.

It's almost impossible to find leaked passwords after they're removed from the list on pastebin.com. Either they have been deleted by Pastebin's techs or the upload is just one in the crowd. To be honest it's easier to find a needle in a haystack then find outdated uploads on Pastebin. Parallel downloading! More than twice as fast as the previous version. 555 files downloaded, over ~20.000 accounts found via auto brute-force using one command that takes approximately 4.51 seconds (see proof below) Incredibly good results for successful attacks. There is no other tool nearby that has more successful attempts than Emagnet. Emagnet is quick, easy, unique and awesome! Google used Emagnet's source to analyze their own site about 1year ago, this is how people are trying to attack accounts today. No skills needed, even your grandmother can use Emagnet! Bruteforce ssh targets and Microsoft Remote Desktop clients - extremely fast portscanning to choose our targets with X port open (netcat/xargs) Super easy to add your own tools using inotifywait with Emagnet - See script example here ./emagnet -g gmail will automate the attack for gmail/google accounts only - We skip the rest! Read more on Google's security blog and automated-tools (emagnet) Even 1 year after using Emagnet to analyze Google, it is still the best tool for it's purpose (2020-07-19) (7% using 2FA) If the user does not have 2FA enable, you will succeed!

Hardware Used: Arduino SA Uno R3 (CDC ACM) DLINK 6100LH IPCam System: Gentoo Linux About/Info/Reason Why I disassembled this dlink camera is because I did not have the password and in the Dlinks app you can only add the camera by connecting to their wifi so I disassembled the device and hoped that it would be easy to get root access and solve this the problem. It was easy done and there is three screws to disassemble this device and three contacts to release, txd/rxd/ gnd I found within 1 seconds, to the left of the micro-usb input, see pictures below. However, I logged in to the access point from the camera since password is printed in stdout when reading serial console and now I could finally use the camera because it is quite good for the cheap price you get it for in 1080p, I THOUGHT!

We all can belive how things are but proof is allways neded. What a fucking joke, Boycott all IoT and american companies for your own safety and go buy the IoT devices from asia instead, no reason to pay 10x when you dont need. Odd Info And we all *nix n3rds is well aware of 2034, odd odd its on the board on this camera. See upper left corner :) STdin/STdout We read serial console with a while loop and writing to a file, with some simple bash tricks without using screen or other tools, we can write to file and grep what we want as we want, see below: Script for read serial communication #!/bin/bash while true ; do tty = /dev/ttyACM0 exec 4 < $tty 5 > $tty stty -F $tty 115200 -echo > & 5 ; read r < & 4 ; echo \" $r \" ; done | tee dc_6200lh.txt The while loop creates a 'monitor' for the serial communication. If you wanna bruteforce the login just for fun then then we want to see what happens and thereforce its the perfect way to go for see what is going on another window, however it's an awesome way to read serial stdin without using more advanced languages for this kind of tasks, below is an example how we can could use expect for a bruteforce script: set baud 115200 if { $argc >= 1 } { set tty [ lindex $argv 0 ] } if { $argc >= 2 } { set baud [ lindex $argv 1 ] } spawn screen / dev / ttyACM0 $baud send \\ r expect { \"DCS-6100LH login: \" { send admin \\ r expect \"Password: \" send $pin-codes \\ r } \"#\" } interact ..since we know the pin-code is a length of six numbers we could generate numbers from 00000-999999 in a simple bash for loop, however since the device in serial replies within milliseconds (this is often set on the other side but not on this dlink camera it seems, it has no time limit set for failed passwords) I would hack this pin-code within few minutes, ~10minutes max with my slow CPU ( Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5600U CPU @ 2.60GHz ) My CPU generates 000000 to 999999 in 26 seconds, we want to stay on the safe side when we bruteForcing so a timeout is needed for not miss any true value when pincode is found, a timeout every 500ms for every failed login by using 'set timeout X' in the code snippet above would be perfect for not fuck up the exit code so we know when the value is true and the pin code is found, however see below and copy and paste and if you have some basic knowledge about tcl and shell, you have everything you need to getting started: for pin-codes in $( seq -w 000000 99999 ) ; do ....tcl code above .......**set timeout -1** done TCL pwnz when we using serial communications for 'expect(ing)' and automate stuff via serial communication, whatever. Lets move further and see how we grab everything in plain-text without using some hacking scripts. Grep WiFi Password We can read the dc_6200lh.txt in realtime, and also we can grep what we want - Nice ! tail -f dc_6200lh.txt | egrep -i \"Wifi_ap_pwd\" And, ohyeah here we go, pin-code found: tail -f dc_6200lh.txt | egrep -o 'user=admin,pass=......' Catching, done . No hacks needed and no brute-force needed. See Full Boot Process Right click on the video and press open image on a new tab for get 1080p resolution for readable text.

Find the reset pin. It is active low. Connect that pin to ground for at least a us. Of course the chip has to be powered and you have to make sure that you are not applying a ground signal to the pin if it is being held high, unless the circuitry can support that. A reset returns the chip to the power on state. A reset does not erase the flash memory. On the 8-pin package it is a little more complicated and it depends on some other factors. In fact, the pin that you would use to perform the reset can be programed as an I/O pin and not a reset pin. I know your question specifically asks if you should do that with or without power and I am intentionally avoiding answering that at this point except to say that if no power is on anywhere, you will not be resetting the chip. My guess is that you do not really want to reset the chip; you want to reset a portion of your BIOS that is stored on the chip and you hope that you can do that by simply resetting the chip. It is possible that when the system boots up, it looks at that pin/line (which again can be configured as I/O) and if it reads as GND while it is booting up (i.e., it would normally be high); it interrupts the normal boot and executes special code that re-writes dedicated areas of memory that hold configuration data (exactly the kind of data that can appear to brick the machine if it gets corrupted). That could, therefore, be a way that a technician might be able to restore the factory defaults if the code exists to do so. That is possible, but you would need to make certain it is the case and not just hope it is because it is also possible to do additional damage, especially if you very little experience with such matters. In my opinion, it is not possible to clear the BIOS by resetting the chip alone. I had an unpleasant experience attempting to help someone who was following such a train of thought (with a different computer) and it was a one way trip. I regret that I ever had attempted to help him at all. But that was my choice and I am willing to help you if I can, as are many others on here.

It's all about extremely poor security in the firmware. No password will be provided at all on this wiki due to convicted judgment in the district court.

Read more about his job here and about the judgment decision and info about this can be found http://nao.vindevag.com/ If you still using this router (its pretty good to be honest) then do yourself a favor and take control over the router, here is some articles about Inteno FG500 Ownit Deploys Wifi Routers With Security Hole Across Sweden Inteno CWMP certificate validation vulnerability And from now, there is another bug wich i will expose in this repo! ;-) A notice to all nerds. If you will copy the wiki and steal the real developers work will not make you a hacker. Default views Let's hack! To get telnet, ssh and all other services enable as an administrator via wusemans method if Daniels password does not work for your isp, then use the bug I have found.

Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program\u2013to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS Definitions. \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations. To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work. A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. Source Code. The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work. A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. Additional Terms. \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. Patents. A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\". A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: <program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. The hypothetical commands show w' and show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\". You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ . The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

Now you should be able to visit the Matomo web-based install wizard at http://w.nr1.nu , but before entering any information, let\u2019s enable HTTPS. Enable HTTPS To encrypt the HTTP traffic when you visit the Matomo web interface, we can enable HTTPS by installing a free TLS certificate issued from Let\u2019s Encrypt. Run the following commands to install Let\u2019s Encrypt client (certbot) on Ubuntu 20.04. apt update apt install certbot If you use Nginx, you also need to install the Certbot Nginx plugin. apt install python3-certbot-nginx Then run the following command to obtain and install TLS certificate. certbot --nginx --agree-tos --redirect --hsts --staple-ocsp --email wuseman@nr1.nu -d w.nr1.nu If you use Apache, you also need to install the Certbot Apache plugin. emerge app-crypt/certbot-apache apt install python3-certbot-apache Then run this command to obtain and install TLS certificate. certbot --apache --agree-tos --redirect --hsts --staple-ocsp --email you@example.com -d w.nr1.nu Step 6: Finish the Installation in your Web Browser [ visit http://localhost/matomo/ ]( https://w.nr1.nu ) Permissions problem chown -R wuseman:wuseman /var/www/html/ find /var/www/html/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\; find /var/www/html/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\; find /var/www/html/assets/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\; find /var/www/html/assets/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\; find /var/www/html/cache/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\; find /var/www/html/cache/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\; find /var/www/html/logs/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\; find /var/www/html/logs/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\; find /var/www/html/tcpdf/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\; find /var/www/html/tcpdf/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\; find /var/www/html/templates_c -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\; find /var/www/html/templates_c -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\; Install By Copy And Paste mysql -e \"drop datababse matomo\" mysql -e \"create database matomo;\" mysql -e \"create user wuseman@localhost identified by 'odemnn';\" mysql -e \"grant all privileges on matomo.* to wuseman@localhost;\" mysql -e \"flush privileges;\" wget https://builds.matomo.org/matomo-latest.zip unzip matomo-latest.zip -d /var/www/html/site chown wuseman:wuseman /var/www/html/site -R google-chrome-stable http://localhost/matomo Add below JS script inside header on your website, edit the setSiteId if needed <!-- Matomo --> < script > var _paq = window . _paq = window . _paq || []; /* tracker methods like \"setCustomDimension\" should be called before \"trackPageView\" */ _paq . push ([ 'trackPageView' ]); _paq . push ([ 'enableLinkTracking' ]); ( function () { var u = \"//w.nr1.nu/\" ; _paq . push ([ 'setTrackerUrl' , u + 'matomo.php' ]); _paq . push ([ 'setSiteId' , '1' ]); var d = document , g = d . createElement ( 'script' ), s = d . getElementsByTagName ( 'script' )[ 0 ]; g . async = true ; g . src = u + 'matomo.js' ; s . parentNode . insertBefore ( g , s ); })(); < /script> <!-- End Matomo Code --> End!","title":"matomo"},{"location":"linux/matomo/#matomo","text":"","title":"matomo"},{"location":"linux/matomo/#download-matomo","text":"wget https://builds.matomo.org/matomo-latest.zip","title":"Download Matomo"},{"location":"linux/matomo/#once-downloaded-extract-the-archive-with-unzip","text":"mkdir -p /var/www/html/site/ wget https://builds.matomo.org/matomo-latest.zip unzip matomo-latest.zip -d /var/www/html/site The -d option specifies the target directory.

Tcpdump is for everyone for hackers and people who have less of TCP/IP understanding. Many prefer to use higher-level analysis tools such Wireshark, but I believe it is a mistake . Below are some tcpdump options (with useful examples) that will help you working with the tool. They\u2019re very easy to forget and/or confuse with other types of filters, i.e. ethereal, so hopefully this article can serve as a reference for you, as it does me:) The first of these is -n, which requests that names are not resolved, resulting in the IPs themselves. The second is -X, which displays both hex and ascii content within the packet. The final one is -S, which changes the display of sequence numbers to absolute rather than relative. Show the packet\u2019s contents in both hex and ascii. tcpdump -X .... Same as -X, but also shows the ethernet header. tcpdump -XX Show the list of available interfaces tcpdump -D Line-readable output (for viewing as you save, or sending to other commands) tcpdump -l Be less verbose (more quiet) with your output. tcpdump -q Give human-readable timestamp output. tcpdump -t : Give maximally human-readable timestamp output. tcpdump -tttt : Listen on the eth0 interface. tcpdump -i eth0 Verbose output (more v\u2019s gives more output). tcpdump -vv Only get x number of packets and then stop. tcpdump -c Define the snaplength (size) of the capture in bytes. Use -s0 to get everything, unless you are intentionally capturing less. tcpdump -s Print absolute sequence numbers. tcpdump -S Get the ethernet header as well. tcpdump -e Decrypt IPSEC traffic by providing an encryption key. tcpdump -E For more options, read manual: Find all options here BASIC USAGE Display Available Interfaces tcpdump -D tcpdump --list-interfaces Let\u2019s start with a basic command that will get us HTTPS traffic: tcpdump -nnSX port 443 Find Traffic by IP tcpdump host 1.1.1.1 Filtering by Source and/or Destination tcpdump src 1.1.1.1 tcpdump dst 1.0.0.1 Finding Packets by Network tcpdump net 1.2.3.0/24 Low Output: tcpdump -nnvvS Medium Output: tcpdump -nnvvXS Heavy Output: tcpdump -nnvvXSs 1514 Getting Creative Expressions are very nice, but the real magic of tcpdump comes from the ability to combine them in creative ways in order to isolate exactly what you\u2019re looking for.
