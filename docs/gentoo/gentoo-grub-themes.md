# gentoo-grub-themes

A few simple Grub2 themes designed with proud gentoo users in mind. They are designed to complement my <a href="github.com/telemin/gentoo-slim-themes">SLiM</a> themes in the same style.

# Design Notes

### Gradient

The light gradient runs between #8f88bd - #f8f7fb

### Fonts

Fonts are the shortcoming of most Grub themes, this is a limitation with Grub itself, which uses the
ppf2 font format which lacks any kerning whatsoever. Fonts can be converted with grub-mkfont, but the
results are highly variable.  

Anyone who has suggestions to improve the overall look of the fonts, particularly in the minimalist theme, please shoot me a message.
