  <h1 align="center"># wspider (v1.0)</h1>
  <h3 align="center">Probably one of the fastest crawler <i>you've</i> ever seen</h3>
</p>


This is a newer version of former [wmirror](https://github.com/wuseman/wmirror) wich now is archived and I will spend alot more time on wspider and it will be ALOT more powerful, wmirror was using single thread with old wget during download and **wspider** is downloading how many files you want. wspider extremely small and fast and I will do my best for add support for authentications asap so you can crawl sites you've logged in to.

Like I said, it is probably one of the fastest crawler/spider tool around that is minimal and just require wget2 and coreutils! 

wspider is **EXTREMLY** powerful and fast and is using wget2 and In many cases wget2 downloads much faster than wget1.x due to HTTP2, HTTP compression, parallel connections and use of If-Modified-Since HTTP header.

<b>Be careful and use wspider on your own risk, maybe its to fast4u!</b><br><br>
<b>Happy crawling! ; )</b>
